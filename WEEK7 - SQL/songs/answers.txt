Through this problem set, I learned how to use SQL to filter and analyze data from a database.
One of the more challenging parts was understanding how JOINs work, especially when linking multiple tables together.
 also found the AVG and LIKE functions intuitive after some practice.
 Overall, writing readable SQL queries helped me understand how databases are queried in the real world.
